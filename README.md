# res_2_voltage

This is a basic firmware for a MSP430FR2111 microcontroller used with my thermistor to voltage output board. This device is used to convert GM thermistors signals to a buffered analog output voltage that can be connected directly to the secondary O2 signal input on the ECU for datalogging on track.
